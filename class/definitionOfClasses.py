"""
Python classes allow programmers to group data and information like
 variables and functions into a single organized unit.

 
inheritance: derived/child class can use attributes and methods of
parent class
multiple inheritance: derived/child class can inherit attributes and
methods from more than one class
polymorphism: derived/child classes can override class methods of
parent class


class variables =

The statements or information inside of a class are usually functions, but a class can also contain 
class variables that are specific to the class and usable throughout the entire class.

Instance variables = and those variables are specific to any Objects that are created by the class.



 There are some features of a class which will require more explanation including:

The __init__ method, which allows every instance of a class to be created with specific parameters
The __init__ method has parameters that accept arguments which determine the attributes 
of the Object when it is created.

The self variable which allows information to be shared easily and efficiently.
The self variable in Python represents an instance of a class, and specifically 
it references the instance of the class that has been created.
We use self in order to make available all of the attributes to the methods throughout the class.
